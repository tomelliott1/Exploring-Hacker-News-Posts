    "\n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by startup incubator Y Combinator. It consists of user-generated posts that are voted and commented on, and is extremely popular in technology and startup circles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two specific types of posts are of interest to us in this project: `Ask HN` and `Show HN`. `Ask HN` posts comprise of users asking questions to the Hacker News community, whereas `Show HN` posts are created to share a topic with the community, for example a project, product or interesting news article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key analysis that I aim to provide in this Python will draw on recently acquired skills and provide the following information:\n",
    "1. Do `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "2. Do posts created at a certain time generate more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing data\n",
    "The data set that will be used for this analysis can be found [here][1], and features almost 300,000 Hacker News posts in the 12 months up to 26/09/2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fistly the data will be imported and saved as a list-of-lists variable `hn`. The header row for the data is then saved in `headers`, while `hn` is updated to remove the header row, thus containing only data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`headers` and the first 3 entried in the data set `hn` are printed below to understand the data set structure.\n",

    "- Of the \"Ask HN\" and \"Show HN\" post types, the \"Ask HN\" post type generated over double the number of comments on average than \"Show HN\". Therefore, users aiming for their posts to be promoted to the top ranked Hacker News posts should favour \"Ask HN\" type posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When considering the number of comments generated on a post, it matters when the post was created. Therefore, users hoping for thier posts to be featured should consider posting at specific times.\n",
    "- For users posting from the UK, posts created between 19:00 - 19:59 GMT are significantly more successful in terms of number of comments than any other hour interval, generating on average 28.68 comments per post. This is over 12 comments more than the next most favourable hourly interval (17:00 - 17:59, with 16.32 average comments per post)\n"
